# AmdLogAnalysis

 ---HOW TO USE---
 
 To run the script place the .csv you want to scrape
 in the same folder with this script file. Then open 
 command line (and navigate to the folder the script 
 and .csv are in) and type: "python ScrapeCSV.py filename"
 where filename is the name of the .csv file.


 ---WHERE TO FIND AMD ADRENALINE LOGS
 
 AMD adrenaline log files by default are found 
 in C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/AMD/CN/ folder, with name 
 Hardware.xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx.CSV where the xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx
 is the time when the log has ended, such as 20240606-130101.
